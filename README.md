# Backend part of a audio tool for mentally ill patients to speak their grievance
The tool that we have developed is basically an audio tool that will take the inputs from mentally ill patients, in which they speak about their grievance like they are suffering from different-different problems and mental issues, etc. Like most of the time, mentally ill patients hesitate to share their feelings and what is going into their mind, so we strongly think this tool will help them in a good manner. Because this tool provides an interface where in one click, they can easily share their thoughts and feelings in an audio. For Design this project we use Java Swing , java awt and java sound sampled and For storing the data we used MySql database. 
Our task is to design the Backend part of the project that will store the data into the MySql database. 

## Note Our Team did only Backend part and other team did the Front end part.
